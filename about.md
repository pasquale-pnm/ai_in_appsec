### About the author
My name is Pasquale Kress and I am a cyber security engineer. I have been an infosec and  cyber security enthusiast since 2009. This drove me to study computer science, which I did in Berlin, Germany with a focus on embedded systems engineering. In 2016 I began working as a web developer and worked on various projects, mainly in fintech. My passion for hacking and security drove me to pursue various InfoSEC certifications, such as the CEH. My areas of expertise are Web Application Pentesting, Network Pentesting, Source Code Reviews and Mobile Application Pentesting. My experience extends to Social Engineering Pentesting and comprehensive Wireless security testing engagements.
